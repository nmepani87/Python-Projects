<h1>Python Projects</h1>

<p>This repository will contain projects that I will be doing as part of my learning as a student in the Software Developer Bootcamp of The Tech Academy. They are basic projects written in Python and use various modules such as Tkinter and SQLite3 </p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Phonebook</li>
  <li>Mean or Nice</li>
  <li>Check Files Gui </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Phonebook</h3>
 <p>In this project, I created a phone book using Tkinter. In here the user is able to save a contact's name, phone number and email into a database. Also included is the function to be able to update or delete previously stored enteries.</p>
 
  <h3>Mean or Nice</h3>
 <p>In this project, I created a Mean or Nice game. Created in IDLE, the users is asked questions and a response is given to their answer. If after a certain number of times the answer has reached its nice/mean counter limit a final response is given along with a picture that pops up.</p>
 
  <h3>Check Files Gui</h3>
 <p>In this project, I created a file transfer Gui using Tkinter and SQLite. This project allows a user to transfer all their .txt files from one chosen directory to another. All the files that are moved are saved in the database and printed in Python Shell to let them know which ones they were. </p>
